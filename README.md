This is a Computational Vision project that uses the Viola Jones algorithm to do face detection.

TO COMPILE:

Type the following in order:

cmake . ( Make sure CMake is installed on your system )
make

FaceDetection then takes 1 Parameter, an image.
HaarDetection also takes 1 Parameter, an image.

Example: ./FaceDetection gma.pgm
Example: ./HaarDetection gma.pgm
